If \na change is issued by the DHS all changes in procedures/directions for entering and performing work at the site will be \ncommunicated to the contractor through the COR. Contractor’s access to the DOC campus grounds may occasionally be \nrestricted as a result of a change in the Nation’s Threat Level when publicly announced by DHS.  \n \n5. National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) \na. The National Terrorism Advisory System, or NTAS, replaces the color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS). \nThis new system will more effectively communicate information about terrorist threats by providing timely, detailed \ninformation to the public, government agencies, first responders, airports and other transportation hubs, and the \nprivate sector. \nb. It recognizes that Americans all share responsibility for the nation’s security and should always be aware of the \nheightened risk of terrorist attack in the United States and what they should do. \n \n6. NTAS Alerts \na. After reviewing the available information, the Secretary of Homeland Security will decide, in coordination with other \nFederal entities, whether an NTAS Alert should be issued. \n\nb. NTAS Alerts will only be issued when credible information is available. \nc. These alerts will include a clear statement that there is an imminent threat or elevated threat. Using available \ninformation, the alerts will provide a concise summary of the potential threat, information about actions being taken to \nensure public safety, and recommended steps that individuals, communities, businesses and governments can take to \nhelp prevent, mitigate or respond to the threat. \nd. The NTAS Alerts will be based on the nature of the threat: in some cases, alerts will be sent directly to law enforcement \nor affected areas of the private sector, while in others, alerts will be issued more broadly to the American people \nthrough both official and media channels. \ne. NTAS Alerts contain a sunset provision indicating a specific date when the alert expires - there will not be a constant \nNTAS Alert or blanket warning that there is an overarching threat. If threat information changes for an alert, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security may announce an updated NTAS Alert. All changes, including the announcement that \ncancels an NTAS Alert, will be distributed the same way as the original alert. \nf. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \ng. Threat Levels: \ni. Low Condition (Green): A Low Condition is declared when there is a low risk of terrorist attacks. \n1.

Development or redevelopment projects with a footprint greater than 5000 square feet are required to comply with Section \n438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) and include stormwater BMPs that produce the \npredevelopment hydrology of the site, effectively resulting in a runoff coefficient comparable to grassland (approximately \n0.4). This includes both the quantity and quality of runoff. This applies to the design and construction of new facilities or \nplans for redevelopment of facilities at the end of the life cycle. This requirement does not apply to repairs made to \noperable facilities such as roof repairs and resurfacing of roadways or parking areas. This requirement may also be excluded \nfrom a project if a separate project or phase of a large project is planned to meet the requirements of EISA Section 438. The \nCOR and contracting officer will make this determination. \n \n11. The dewatering of construction sites is covered under the MS4 permit if the groundwater to be removed meets the water \nquality standards in 5 CCR 1002-31 and 38 and has a total suspended solids content of less than 30 mg/L. There is no known \nor suspected contamination of groundwater at the DoC Boulder Labs. Discovery of suspected contamination (unusual odor, \ncolor, etc.) must be reported to the COR immediately. Dewatering and discharge to the storm sewer system may not \ncontinue until sampling and analyses have been performed and compliance with 5 CCR 1002-31 and 38 have been verified. \nPlans for construction projects involving excavation at or near the water table must include a plan to comply with these \nrequirements. Portable tanks may be necessary to contain water until analytical results have been received. The use of \nportable tanks to contain water prior to receipt of analytical results may be required. At minimum, settling of suspended \n\nsolids will be necessary. Note: Dewatering, treatment and discharge of contaminated groundwater requires a separate \npermit. Obtaining a dewatering permit from EPA may take up to six months. \n \n12. On construction projects required to be permitted under the EPA eNOI system, designs must be reviewed by a landscape \narchitect or landscape planner to ensure that revegetation will meet the requirements of the CGP and control the growth of \nnoxious weeds.

Collins, CO & Kauai, HI \n \nAttachment 13 \nContract Transition Requirements \nSeptember 2020 \n \n \na)   Services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without \ninterruption.  In accordance with contract clause 52.237-3, Continuity of Services, both \nthe incoming and outgoing contractors shall provide services to facilitate an orderly and \nefficient transition to the contractor selected for the award of this contract and the \nsubsequent follow-on Central Utility Plant (CUP) Operations and Maintenance contract. \n \nb)  The transition period between contractors shall be the first 30 days of the new contract \nand the final 30 days of the existing contract.  During the 30 day transition the \nincumbent contractor shall cooperate and provide support with the transition of the \nsuccessor contractor as outlined below. \n \nc)   Incumbent Contractor Responsibilities \n \ni)   During the 30 day transition the incumbent shall fully staff the CUP per the contract \nrequirements, shall perform all contract requirements, and is fully responsible for \ncontract performance. \n \n1)   All performance requirements related to CLIN X001 shall remain in place to include \nchemical treatment, preventative maintenance, minor repairs etc.  The Contractor \nshall ensure that the plant is operable to meet daily load requirements for Steam, \nChilled Water, and laboratory-grade air.    \n \n2)   The incumbent shall continue to meet all contractual obligations for the \npreventative maintenance for the 30 days for CLINS X002, X003, and any remaining \nauthorized work orders or emergency work orders issued under CLIN X004. \n \n3)   The incumbent shall remain the first responder to alarms. \n \nii)    The successor contractor is authorized to staff the CUP facility and Boulder Site with \none stationary engineer and one mechanic during each 8-hour shift for purposes of \nobservation and familiarization with current operations and processes, to include \nwitnessing responses to alarms.  This transition is referred to as “shadowing”.  The \nincumbent contractor shall accommodate the successor contractor staff in the CUP and \non the Boulder Site and cooperate with the successor contractor during the 30-day \ntransition or shadowing period.    \n \niii) The incumbent contractor shall coordinate a date during the 30-day    transition in which \nthe transition of chemical storage shall be transitioned between contractors.  \n \niv)    The government will provide general Maximo and Metasys training to the successor \ncontractor.   \n \nv)   The incumbent shall be responsible for providing training on the following:   \n \n1)   Boilers: \nHow to swap the boilers from manual to automatic \nGo through a manual transfer to the generators at the CUP \nStartup/shutdown of a boiler \nTransferring from one boiler to another \n \n2)   Chilled Water System: \n\nNIST Boulder Central Utility Plant, Operations, Maintenance and Repair        1333ND21CNB190017 \n \nChiller rotation – How to rotate the chiller to the one you want when you are doing \nmaintenance \nReview of the flushing of the strainers for the cooling towers \nRotation of cooling towers \nHow to reverse the blades of the cooling towers for a defrost cycle \n \n3)   Air Compressors/Dryers: \nSwapping the air compressors from condenser water to domestic water and back. \nChangeover of air compressors and air dryers for manual rotation \n \n4)   How to operate the plant in manual mode (without Metasys): \nChillers/Cooling Towers \nBoilers \nAir Compressors \n \n5)   Water chemistry – demonstrate for successor contractor how water chemistry \ntesting/monitoring is currently completed. \n \niv)    During the 30 day transition the incumbent shall coordinate and work with one \nstationary engineer and one mechanic during each 8-hour shift.  Allowing the successor \ncontractor to observe the plant in operation 24/7 shall be key in the transition.  \nAllowing observation in the swing and mid shifts will allow the successor contractor \nthe ability to witness out of hours responses.   \n \nv)   The incumbent remains first responder to alarms shall take the on-duty mechanic from \nthe successor contractor with them on the alarm response.   \n \nvi)    In addition, the incumbent contractor shall insure the successor contractor \nparticipates in all mechanical room walks and any chemical checks for the existing \nequipment on the Boulder site. \n \nd)    Successor Contractor Responsibilities \n \ni)   The successor contractor shall staff, at a minimum, one stationary engineer and one \nmechanic per 8-hour shift.  The successor contractor shall obtain a NIST email, all \nrequired network/system access (Metasys/Maximo), and be able to access, view Metasys \nand acknowledge or respond to alarms with the incumbent contractor. \n \nii)    During the 30 day transition the successor contractor shall observe the incumbent \ncontractor in the operation of the CUP 24/7.  In addition, they shall respond with the \nincumbent contractor on-shift mechanic the for alarm responses. \n \niii) The successor contractor shall obtain Maximo and Metasys training during the 30-day \ntransition from the appropriate NIST personnel.  Trainings will be offered between the \nhours of 7:00-3:30; the contractor shall make available all personnel for these \ntrainings. \n \niv)    During the 30 day transition a date shall be established to have the mechanic(s) from \nthe successor contractor at the Boulder site for an onsite review of the equipment \nthat is maintained under this contract.  An orientation on what preventative \nmaintenance and repairs have been performed shall be completed with a NIST \nrepresentative.  The successor contractor mechanic shall accompany the incumbent \ncontractor mechanic during their monthly PMs during the 30-day    transition for \nobservation. \n \nv)   During the 30 day transition a date shall be established to have the mechanic(s) from \nthe successor contractor walk each of the main buildings on the NIST site with the \nappropriate building manager.  This will include Buildings: 1, 2, 3, 24, 81, and 92.  \nThe intent will be to identify the different types of HVAC systems operating in the \nbuildings so as to have familiarity when responding to alarms out of hours. \n \nvi)    During the 30 day transition a date shall be established to have a mechanic from the \nsuccessor contractor at the Ft. Collins site for an onsite review of the equipment \n\nNIST Boulder Central Utility Plant, Operations, Maintenance and Repair        1333ND21CNB190017 \n \nthat is maintained.  An orientation on what preventative maintenance and repairs have \nbeen performed shall be completed with a NIST representative. \n \nvii) During the transition between the incumbent contractor and the successor contractor \nthe successor contractor shall not utilize any of the incumbent contractor's property \nsuch as microwave, refrigerator, or personal computers utilized to perform work on \ntheir contract. \n \nviii) During the 30 day transition the successor contractor shall make appropriate \narrangements to install their chemical condenser water and boiler water treatment \nequipment.  The successor contractor shall coordinate installation during the 30 days \nin which the chemical condenser water treatment equipment and its operation shall be \ntransitioned between contractors.  At the end of the 30 days the successor contractor \nshall begin providing chemicals immediately and have their chemical supply on hand.  \nDuring this 30 days, the successor contractor shall provide the chemical parameters to \nalign with their intended chemical treatment plan to the COR for review.  \n \nix)   In the event the incumbent contractor is awarded the follow-on contract there will be \nno transition period and performance shall commence as stated in the follow-on \ncontract. \n ",

This document is intended to provide the necessary information/requirements for all contractors performing work at \nDepartment of Commerce (DOC) facilities. It is understood all information in this document may not apply for the specific \nproject described in the Statement of Work; however, it is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure the requirements \nare met when applicable. \n \n2.    Specifics of the activities are described in the attached Statement of Work and supporting documentation. \n \n3.    Questions about the requirements can be addressed to the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officers Representative \n(COR)/Project Manager designated for the specific task order. \n \n1.2 BACKGROUND \n \nThe Office of Facilities and Property Management (OFPM) Division manages and provides services to the DOC staff in support of \ntheir research, technical, and administrative programs.  DOC agencies serviced by OFPM include but may not be limited to: The \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), The National Telecommunications and Information Administration \n(NTIA), and The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). \n \n1.3 HOURS OF OPERATION \n \n1. DOC hours of operations are from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, on normal Federal workdays. Should the \nContractor desire to work at times other than those specified above, the dates and hours must be scheduled at least 10 \nworking days in advance and approved in writing by the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR). \n \n2. Use the Main Entrance at the DOC site for materials supply and entry for: \na. Special arrangements may be made through the COR for delivery of material/supplies, and/or overtime beyond these \nhours or on holidays. \nb. Check-in required at DOC Visitor’s Center located at the site main entrance. \n \n3. Employee identification shall include the name, country of citizenship, employer, and green card (if applicable) is needed for \neach Contractor and Subcontractor's employee working on the DOC site. These shall be submitted to the COR for review 10 \ndays prior to the work date.  After hours work will require a hard badge from the General Contractor and a COR/Federal \nescort 100 percent of time if accessing DOC buildings (see section 3.3). Follow the specific procedures pertaining to security \nand work hours prescribed by the COR/Security. Contractor vehicles must show current registration and proof of insurance. \n \n4. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Advisory System: \nNote: The following paragraphs describe the threat levels that may be changes at any time due to national security issues. If \na change is issued by the DHS all changes in procedures/directions for entering and performing work at the site will be \ncommunicated to the contractor through the COR. Contractor’s access to the DOC campus grounds may occasionally be \nrestricted as a result of a change in the Nation’s Threat Level when publicly announced by DHS.  \n \n5. National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) \na. The National Terrorism Advisory System, or NTAS, replaces the color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS). \nThis new system will more effectively communicate information about terrorist threats by providing timely, detailed \ninformation to the public, government agencies, first responders, airports and other transportation hubs, and the \nprivate sector. \nb. It recognizes that Americans all share responsibility for the nation’s security and should always be aware of the \nheightened risk of terrorist attack in the United States and what they should do. \n \n6. NTAS Alerts \na. After reviewing the available information, the Secretary of Homeland Security will decide, in coordination with other \nFederal entities, whether an NTAS Alert should be issued. \n\nb. NTAS Alerts will only be issued when credible information is available. \nc. These alerts will include a clear statement that there is an imminent threat or elevated threat. Using available \ninformation, the alerts will provide a concise summary of the potential threat, information about actions being taken to \nensure public safety, and recommended steps that individuals, communities, businesses and governments can take to \nhelp prevent, mitigate or respond to the threat. \nd. The NTAS Alerts will be based on the nature of the threat: in some cases, alerts will be sent directly to law enforcement \nor affected areas of the private sector, while in others, alerts will be issued more broadly to the American people \nthrough both official and media channels. \ne. NTAS Alerts contain a sunset provision indicating a specific date when the alert expires - there will not be a constant \nNTAS Alert or blanket warning that there is an overarching threat. If threat information changes for an alert, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security may announce an updated NTAS Alert. All changes, including the announcement that \ncancels an NTAS Alert, will be distributed the same way as the original alert. \nf. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \ng. Threat Levels: \ni. Low Condition (Green): A Low Condition is declared when there is a low risk of terrorist attacks. \n1. Federal departments and agencies will implement general and agency-specific Protective Measures to assure \nthat all facilities and regulated sectors take reasonable measures to mitigate vulnerabilities to terrorist attack. \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \nii. Guarded Condition (Blue): A Guarded Condition is declared when there is a general risk of terrorist attacks. \n1. In addition to Protective Measures taken in previous Threat Condition, Federal departments and agencies will \nimplement general measures in addition to agency-specific Protective Measures to check communications with \ndesignated emergency response or command locations, update emergency response measures, and provide \npublic with information. \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \niii. Elevated Condition (Yellow). An Elevated Condition is declared when there is a significant risk of terrorist attacks.  \n1. In addition to Protective Measures taken in previous Threat Conditions, Federal departments and agencies may \ndevelop protective measures for the DOC campus grounds such as increased surveillance, coordinating \nemergency plans as appropriate with nearby jurisdictions, and implementing contingency and emergency \nresponse plans.  \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR.  \niv. High Condition (Orange): A High Condition is declared when there is a high risk of terrorist attacks.  \n1. In addition to Protective Measures taken in previous Threat Conditions, Federal departments and agencies will \nimplement general and agency-specific Protective Measures for the DOC campus grounds. \n2. At this Threat Level the Government may restrict access to site and facility to essential personnel only.  \n3. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR.  \nv. Severe Condition (Red). A Severe Condition reflects a severe risk of terrorist attacks. \n1. Under most circumstances, the Protective Measures for a Severe Condition are not intended to be sustained for \nsubstantial periods of time. In addition to Protective Measures for previous Threat Conditions, Federal \ndepartments and agencies may close Public and Government sites and facilities as a protective measure. \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \n \n1.4 UNFORESEEN FACILITY CLOSURES \n \n1.    When an unforeseen facility closure occurs, the Contractor will either reschedule the work or perform the work on the next \nregularly scheduled workday. If the facility is closed, the contractor is not to be on-site unless notified by the contracting \nofficer they are essential. Contractor personnel may be required by the COR to remain on site to handle problems as a result \nof a closure, e.g., severe weather, national emergency, changes in national security levels. \n \n2.    Information about the status of the site may be obtained by calling the switch board at 303-497-3000.  Usually the day’s site \nstatus is available by 6 AM MST. Contractor can verify site status and sign up for email and text site notifications at the \nfollowing website:  \nhttp://www.boulder.doc.gov/cgi-bin/docstatus.cgi \n \n1.5 SANITARY FACILITIES \n \n\nToilet rooms in existing buildings may be used by the Contractor when performing work inside DOC owned buildings at the \ndiscretion of the COR.

Development or redevelopment projects with a footprint greater than 5000 square feet are required to comply with Section \n438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) and include stormwater BMPs that produce the \npredevelopment hydrology of the site, effectively resulting in a runoff coefficient comparable to grassland (approximately \n0.4). This includes both the quantity and quality of runoff. This applies to the design and construction of new facilities or \nplans for redevelopment of facilities at the end of the life cycle. This requirement does not apply to repairs made to \noperable facilities such as roof repairs and resurfacing of roadways or parking areas. This requirement may also be excluded \nfrom a project if a separate project or phase of a large project is planned to meet the requirements of EISA Section 438. The \nCOR and contracting officer will make this determination. \n \n11. The dewatering of construction sites is covered under the MS4 permit if the groundwater to be removed meets the water \nquality standards in 5 CCR 1002-31 and 38 and has a total suspended solids content of less than 30 mg/L. There is no known \nor suspected contamination of groundwater at the DoC Boulder Labs. Discovery of suspected contamination (unusual odor, \ncolor, etc.) must be reported to the COR immediately. Dewatering and discharge to the storm sewer system may not \ncontinue until sampling and analyses have been performed and compliance with 5 CCR 1002-31 and 38 have been verified. \nPlans for construction projects involving excavation at or near the water table must include a plan to comply with these \nrequirements. Portable tanks may be necessary to contain water until analytical results have been received. The use of \nportable tanks to contain water prior to receipt of analytical results may be required. At minimum, settling of suspended \n\nsolids will be necessary. Note: Dewatering, treatment and discharge of contaminated groundwater requires a separate \npermit. Obtaining a dewatering permit from EPA may take up to six months. \n \n12. On construction projects required to be permitted under the EPA eNOI system, designs must be reviewed by a landscape \narchitect or landscape planner to ensure that revegetation will meet the requirements of the CGP and control the growth of \nnoxious weeds. All other construction projects must comply with NIST/DoC Boulder Labs requirements for revegetation. \n \n13. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or permit terms may result in work stoppage and/or other contractual actions. \na. On construction sites regulated under the CGP and eNOI system, contractors must begin repairs on deficient (improperly \ninstalled, missing or ineffective) stormwater BMPs on the day on which the deficient condition is first observed and \ncomplete repairs by the end of the following day unless replacement of the BMP is required. The CGP allows 7 days for \nreplacement of BMPs. Any failure to adhere to this requirement must be noted in the SWPPP log and reported to the \nCOR. \nb. For projects not regulated under the CGP and eNOI system, if deficient stormwater protection exists at the fault of the \ncontractor, the contractor shall make repairs according to the schedule in Item 1, aside from the requirement to \ndocument in the SWPPP log. \nc. If corrective actions are the responsibility of the government and require separate contract actions, acquisition of \ncontractor services and/or procurement of materials will be initiated by NIST AMD within 72 hours of receipt of a \ndefined requirement and evidence of availability of funds. \n \n2.10 FIRE PREVENTION/PROTECTION \n \n1.    The contractor will comply with all fire prevention recommendations of the International Fire Code - 2003 edition, and the \nNational Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Regulations which are incorporated herein by reference.

This project must be completed within the contracted period of performance (per FAR 52.211-10).  With initial proposal and \nprior to commencement of work the contractor must provide detailed project schedule in Microsoft Project or other \nscheduling software to the COR for acceptance.  Final schedule shall be agreed upon after NTP at post-award meeting.   \n \n3.    Notify the COR of the work progress and any required inspections three working days in advance of all inspections. Upon \nsubstantial completion, request a punch list inspection with the COR and CO five working days in advance.  COR will submit \nto CO and Contractor a written list of items requiring completion or correction. Contractor will respond to list with an \nanticipated schedule of completion of outstanding items. \n\n \n4.    The Contractor shall also be responsible for all materials delivered and work performed until completion and acceptance of \nthe entire work, except for any completed unit of work which may have been accepted under the contract. \n \n5.    The coordination of activities between the COR, the contractor and the building occupants is critical in an effort to \nminimize disruption of the research and damage to ongoing experiments. The notification of building occupants is the \nCOR’s responsibility. \n \n6.    Entrance into laboratories is normally not required. If entrance into the area is required the contractor shall contact the COR \nor his/her designee a minimum of 5 working days prior, and arrangements with the owner/occupant to ensure work to be \nperformed will not disrupt or damage technical experiments/projects in the specified area will be coordinated.  \n \n7.    When special entrance requirements are deemed necessary the COR and or his/her designee will make arrangements for \ncontractor personnel to have the necessary briefings and training prior to entrance into the specified area. \n \n8.    To the extent possible, the contractor must assign specific staff to this site and this contract. \n \n4.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTATION PROCEDURES \n \nAll submittals shall be submitted to the COR in a timely manner to allow ten working days for review. The return of disapproved \nsubmittals and their resubmission is not a basis for time extension. All Requests For Information (RFI) shall be submitted in \nwriting and will be returned by the COR in a timely manner. Notify the COR via RFI with any conflicts associated with this Scope \nof Work, drawings and any appendixes in a timely manner. \n \n4.3 PERMIT REQUIRED OPERATIONS DURING CONSTRUCTION OR MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES \n \n1.    To ensure safety as a priority, to ensure individuals performing certain operations have the appropriate training and \nequipment, and to prevent unnecessary utility outages DOC has the following permits which are required when performing \ntasks/functions to support this contract/project. \n \n2.    The policies and procedures can be obtained from the Government COR/Operations Supervisor and are required prior to the \nwork being performed. \n \n3.    The activities requiring permits are: \na.

Hot Work Permit (48-hour advance notice to COR) \nd. Fire Protection System Impairment Permit (5 working days advance notice to COR) \ne. Excavation Permit (48-hour advance notice to COR) \n \n4.    All organizations performing work on behalf of the DOC are also required to have a current Lock-out/Tag-out policy and all \nemployees must be currently indoctrinated on company procedures. If necessary, OFPM has a policy/procedure that can be \nobtained from the COR/ Operations Supervisor. \n \n5.    Maintain a record set of all inspections, permits or other authorizations necessary for the work to proceed. \n \n4.4 MAINTENANCE OF WORK SITE \n \nBecause this facility has 24/7 operation, work sites shall be kept in an organized, safe and clean manner (see FAR 52.236-10). \nDebris and garbage shall be cleaned at the end of each work day. Any materials or equipment stored in approved areas shall be \nleft in an orderly manner. Regular maintenance of working areas shall be the responsibility of the contractor (ie. outside areas \nshall be mowed if necessary, hallways shall be swept and kept clear of trip hazards). The Contractor shall perform final cleaning \nand detailing of work areas at completion of the project (see FAR 52.236-12).  \n \n\n4.5 WORK REQUIRING ADVANCE NOTICE AND COORDINATION \n \nNIST is a functioning laboratory facility operating on a 24/7 schedule. As such,  10 working days’ notice to the COR is required for \nany activity that could potentially impact NIST employee safety, work or facility operation outside of the work area. These \nactivities include, but are not limited to, utility outages; parking lot or road closures; work impacting access to corridors or \nspaces outside of the work area; loud work such as core drilling,  jack-hammering, etc.; work creating vibration; and work that \nmay produce odors. Any outages impacting significant research activities will require a minimum of 10 and up to 25 working \ndays’ notice to COR for coordination unless otherwise noted in contract.  \n  \n\nAppendix \n \nRoof Access Permit \n \nPenetration Permit \n \nHot Work Permit \n \nFire Protection System Impairment \n \nExcavation Permit \n  \n\nRoof Access Permit \n \n\n \n\n  \n\nPenetration Permit \n  \n\nHot Work Permit \n  \n\nFire Protection System Impairment \n  \n\nExcavation Permit \n ",

Collins, CO & Kauai, HI \n \nAttachment 13 \nContract Transition Requirements \nSeptember 2020 \n \n \na)   Services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without \ninterruption.  In accordance with contract clause 52.237-3, Continuity of Services, both \nthe incoming and outgoing contractors shall provide services to facilitate an orderly and \nefficient transition to the contractor selected for the award of this contract and the \nsubsequent follow-on Central Utility Plant (CUP) Operations and Maintenance contract. \n \nb)  The transition period between contractors shall be the first 30 days of the new contract \nand the final 30 days of the existing contract.  During the 30 day transition the \nincumbent contractor shall cooperate and provide support with the transition of the \nsuccessor contractor as outlined below. \n \nc)   Incumbent Contractor Responsibilities \n \ni)   During the 30 day transition the incumbent shall fully staff the CUP per the contract \nrequirements, shall perform all contract requirements, and is fully responsible for \ncontract performance. \n \n1)   All performance requirements related to CLIN X001 shall remain in place to include \nchemical treatment, preventative maintenance, minor repairs etc.  The Contractor \nshall ensure that the plant is operable to meet daily load requirements for Steam, \nChilled Water, and laboratory-grade air.    \n \n2)   The incumbent shall continue to meet all contractual obligations for the \npreventative maintenance for the 30 days for CLINS X002, X003, and any remaining \nauthorized work orders or emergency work orders issued under CLIN X004. \n \n3)   The incumbent shall remain the first responder to alarms. \n \nii)    The successor contractor is authorized to staff the CUP facility and Boulder Site with \none stationary engineer and one mechanic during each 8-hour shift for purposes of \nobservation and familiarization with current operations and processes, to include \nwitnessing responses to alarms.  This transition is referred to as “shadowing”.  The \nincumbent contractor shall accommodate the successor contractor staff in the CUP and \non the Boulder Site and cooperate with the successor contractor during the 30-day \ntransition or shadowing period.    \n \niii) The incumbent contractor shall coordinate a date during the 30-day    transition in which \nthe transition of chemical storage shall be transitioned between contractors.  \n \niv)    The government will provide general Maximo and Metasys training to the successor \ncontractor.   \n \nv)   The incumbent shall be responsible for providing training on the following:   \n \n1)   Boilers: \nHow to swap the boilers from manual to automatic \nGo through a manual transfer to the generators at the CUP \nStartup/shutdown of a boiler \nTransferring from one boiler to another \n \n2)   Chilled Water System: \n\nNIST Boulder Central Utility Plant, Operations, Maintenance and Repair        1333ND21CNB190017 \n \nChiller rotation – How to rotate the chiller to the one you want when you are doing \nmaintenance \nReview of the flushing of the strainers for the cooling towers \nRotation of cooling towers \nHow to reverse the blades of the cooling towers for a defrost cycle \n \n3)   Air Compressors/Dryers: \nSwapping the air compressors from condenser water to domestic water and back. \nChangeover of air compressors and air dryers for manual rotation \n \n4)   How to operate the plant in manual mode (without Metasys): \nChillers/Cooling Towers \nBoilers \nAir Compressors \n \n5)   Water chemistry – demonstrate for successor contractor how water chemistry \ntesting/monitoring is currently completed. \n \niv)    During the 30 day transition the incumbent shall coordinate and work with one \nstationary engineer and one mechanic during each 8-hour shift.  Allowing the successor \ncontractor to observe the plant in operation 24/7 shall be key in the transition.  \nAllowing observation in the swing and mid shifts will allow the successor contractor \nthe ability to witness out of hours responses.   \n \nv)   The incumbent remains first responder to alarms shall take the on-duty mechanic from \nthe successor contractor with them on the alarm response.   \n \nvi)    In addition, the incumbent contractor shall insure the successor contractor \nparticipates in all mechanical room walks and any chemical checks for the existing \nequipment on the Boulder site. \n \nd)    Successor Contractor Responsibilities \n \ni)   The successor contractor shall staff, at a minimum, one stationary engineer and one \nmechanic per 8-hour shift.  The successor contractor shall obtain a NIST email, all \nrequired network/system access (Metasys/Maximo), and be able to access, view Metasys \nand acknowledge or respond to alarms with the incumbent contractor. \n \nii)    During the 30 day transition the successor contractor shall observe the incumbent \ncontractor in the operation of the CUP 24/7.  In addition, they shall respond with the \nincumbent contractor on-shift mechanic the for alarm responses. \n \niii) The successor contractor shall obtain Maximo and Metasys training during the 30-day \ntransition from the appropriate NIST personnel.  Trainings will be offered between the \nhours of 7:00-3:30; the contractor shall make available all personnel for these \ntrainings. \n \niv)    During the 30 day transition a date shall be established to have the mechanic(s) from \nthe successor contractor at the Boulder site for an onsite review of the equipment \nthat is maintained under this contract.  An orientation on what preventative \nmaintenance and repairs have been performed shall be completed with a NIST \nrepresentative.  The successor contractor mechanic shall accompany the incumbent \ncontractor mechanic during their monthly PMs during the 30-day    transition for \nobservation. \n \nv)   During the 30 day transition a date shall be established to have the mechanic(s) from \nthe successor contractor walk each of the main buildings on the NIST site with the \nappropriate building manager.  This will include Buildings: 1, 2, 3, 24, 81, and 92.  \nThe intent will be to identify the different types of HVAC systems operating in the \nbuildings so as to have familiarity when responding to alarms out of hours. \n \nvi)    During the 30 day transition a date shall be established to have a mechanic from the \nsuccessor contractor at the Ft. Collins site for an onsite review of the equipment \n\nNIST Boulder Central Utility Plant, Operations, Maintenance and Repair        1333ND21CNB190017 \n \nthat is maintained.  An orientation on what preventative maintenance and repairs have \nbeen performed shall be completed with a NIST representative. \n \nvii) During the transition between the incumbent contractor and the successor contractor \nthe successor contractor shall not utilize any of the incumbent contractor's property \nsuch as microwave, refrigerator, or personal computers utilized to perform work on \ntheir contract. \n \nviii) During the 30 day transition the successor contractor shall make appropriate \narrangements to install their chemical condenser water and boiler water treatment \nequipment.  The successor contractor shall coordinate installation during the 30 days \nin which the chemical condenser water treatment equipment and its operation shall be \ntransitioned between contractors.  At the end of the 30 days the successor contractor \nshall begin providing chemicals immediately and have their chemical supply on hand.  \nDuring this 30 days, the successor contractor shall provide the chemical parameters to \nalign with their intended chemical treatment plan to the COR for review.  \n \nix)   In the event the incumbent contractor is awarded the follow-on contract there will be \nno transition period and performance shall commence as stated in the follow-on \ncontract. \n ",

All work shall be conducted under the general direction of the \nContracting Officer and is subject to Government inspection and test at all places and at all reasonable times before \nacceptance to ensure strict compliance with the terms of the contract.  \n(c) Government inspections and tests are for the sole benefit of the Government and do not—  \n(1) Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for providing adequate quality control measures;  \n(2) Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for damage to or loss of the material before acceptance;  \n(3) Constitute or imply acceptance; or  \n(4) Affect the continuing rights of the Government after acceptance of the completed work under paragraph (i) of this \nsection.  \n(d) The presence or absence of a Government inspector does not relieve the Contractor from any contract requirement, \nnor is the inspector authorized to change any term or condition of the specification without the Contracting Officer’s written \nauthorization.  \n(e) The Contractor shall promptly furnish, at no increase in contract price, all facilities, labor, and material reasonably \nneeded for performing such safe and convenient inspections and tests as may be required by the Contracting Officer. The \nGovernment may charge to the Contractor any additional cost of inspection or test when work is not ready at the time \nspecified by the Contractor for inspection or test, or when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary. The \nGovernment shall perform all inspections and tests in a manner that will not unnecessarily delay the work. Special, full \nsize, and performance tests shall be performed as described in the contract.  \n(f) The Contractor shall, without charge, replace or correct work found by the Government not to conform to contract \nrequirements, unless in the public interest the Government consents to accept the work with an appropriate adjustment in \ncontract price. The Contractor shall promptly segregate and remove rejected material from the premises.  \n(g) If the Contractor does not promptly replace or correct rejected work, the Government may—  \n(1) By contract or otherwise, replace or correct the work and charge the cost to the Contractor; or  \n(2) Terminate for default the Contractor’s right to proceed.  \n(h) If, before acceptance of the entire work, the Government decides to examine already completed work by removing it \nor tearing it out, the Contractor, on request, shall promptly furnish all necessary facilities, labor, and material. If the work is \nfound to be defective or nonconforming in any material respect due to the fault of the Contractor or its subcontractors, the \nContractor shall defray the expenses of the examination and of satisfactory reconstruction. However, if the work is found \nto meet contract requirements, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment for the additional services \ninvolved in the examination and reconstruction, including, if completion of the work was thereby delayed, an extension of \ntime.  \n(i) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government shall accept, as promptly as practicable after completion \nand inspection, all work required by the contract or that portion of the work the Contracting Officer determines can be \naccepted separately. Acceptance shall be final and conclusive except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting \nto fraud, or the Government’s rights under any warranty or guarantee.  \n(End of clause)  \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 9 of 54 \n \n \n \nSECTION F – DELIVERIES OR PERFORMANCE  \n52.211-10 COMMENCEMENT, PROSECUTION, AND COMPLETION OF WORK (APR 1984) \nThe Contractor shall be required to (a) commence work under this contract within 7 calendar days after the date the \nContractor receives the notice to proceed, (b) prosecute the work diligently, and (c) complete the entire work ready for use \nnot later than 45 calendar days from the issuance of Notice to Proceed.

However, no adjustment \nshall be made under this clause for any suspension, delay, or interruption to the extent that performance would have been \nso suspended, delayed, or interrupted by any other cause, including the fault or negligence of the Contractor, or for which \nan equitable adjustment is provided for or excluded under any other term or condition of this contract.  \n(c) A claim under this clause shall not be allowed—  \n(1) For any costs incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor shall have notified the Contracting Officer in \nwriting of the act or failure to act involved (but this requirement shall not apply as to a claim resulting from a suspension \norder); and  \n(2) Unless the claim, in an amount stated, is asserted in writing as soon as practicable after the termination of the \nsuspension, delay, or interruption, but not later than the date of final payment under the contract.  \n(End of clause) \n \nSECTION G – CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION DATA  \n1452.201-70 AUTHORITIES AND DELEGATIONS (SEPT 2011) \n(a) The Contracting Officer is the only individual authorized to enter into or terminate this contract, modify any term or \ncondition of this contract, waive any requirement of this contract, or accept nonconforming work. \n(b) The Contracting Officer will designate a Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) at time of award.

FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts. The Department \nof the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to \ncomply with this regulation. One or more past performance evaluations may be conducted in order to record your \ncontract performance as required by FAR 42.15. \n2.   The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS. CPARS is a web-based \nsystem that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report. Once the report is processed, it \nis available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past \nperformance as part of a source selection action. \n3.   We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer (CO) with the name, position title, phone number, and email \naddress for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s) for the contract \nno later than 30 days after award. Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the \nContractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 11 of 54 \n \n \n \nreturning the report to the Assessing Official (AO). Information in the report must be protected as source selection \nsensitive information not releasable to the public. \n4.   When your Contractor Representative(s) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically generated \nemail with detailed login instructions. Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS \nis available at https://www.cpars.gov/.  \n5.   Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the AO will complete an interim or final past performance \nevaluation, and the report will be accessible at https://www.cpars.gov/.   \na.   Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the \nevaluation without comment.  \nb.   Your comments should focus on objective facts in the AO's narrative and should provide your views on \nthe causes and ramifications of the assessed performance.  \nc.    All information provided should be reviewed for accuracy prior to submission.  \nd.   If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating \"No \ncomment\" in the space provided, and then selecting “Accept the Ratings and Close the Evaluation”. \ne.   Your response is due within 60 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR. On day 15, the evaluation will \nbecome available in PPIRS-RC marked as “Pending” with or without comments and whether or not it has \nbeen closed. \nf.    If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 60 days, it will automatically be returned to the \nGovernment and will be annotated: \"The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date). The \ncontractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment.\"  \n6.   The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation: \na.   Protect the evaluation as source selection information. After review, transmit the evaluation by completing \nand submitting the form through CPARS. If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the \nform through CPARS, contact the CO for instructions. \nb.   Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization. Ensure the evaluation is never released \nto persons or entities outside of your control. \nc.    Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, pre-award \nsurveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes. \n7.   If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the CO no later \nthan seven days following your receipt of the evaluation. The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or \nother means during your 60-day review period. \n8.   A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for \nGovernment use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.   \n \n(End of Notice) \nELECTRONIC INVOICING AND PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS – INTERNET PAYMENT PLATFORM \n(FEB 2021)  \nPayment requests must be submitted electronically through the U.

As used in this clause— \nCommercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item— \n(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is– \n(i)   A commercial product (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of “commercial product” at \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101); \n(ii)  Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and \n(iii)  Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the \nsame form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and \n(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as agricultural products and \npetroleum products. \n\"Construction material\" means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a \nsubcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled \nfrom articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and \naudio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as \ncomplete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual \nparts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the \nGovernment are supplies, not construction material. \nCost of components means— \n(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place \nof incorporation into the construction material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and \nany applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or \n(2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of \nthe component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable \noverhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the \nmanufacture of the construction material. \nCritical component means a component that is mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States and deemed \ncritical to the U.S. supply chain. The list of critical components is at FAR 25.105. \nCritical item means a domestic construction material or domestic end product that is deemed critical to U.S. supply \nchain resiliency. The list of critical items is at FAR 25.105. \nDomestic construction material means— \n(1)  For construction material that does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of \nboth- \n(i) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States; or \n(ii) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if– \n(A)   The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 60 \npercent of the cost of all its components, except that the percentage will be 65 percent for items \ndelivered in calendar years 2024 through 2028 and 75 percent for items delivered starting in \ncalendar year 2029. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which \nnonavailability determinations have been made are treated as domestic. Components of unknown \norigin are treated as foreign; or \n(B)   The construction material is a COTS item; or \n(2)    For construction material that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, \na construction material manufactured in the United States if the cost of foreign iron and steel constitutes \nless than 5 percent of the cost of all components used in such construction material. The cost of foreign iron \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 26 of 54 \n \n \n \nand steel includes but is not limited to the cost of foreign iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, \nwire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the manufacture of the construction material and a \ngood faith estimate of the cost of all foreign iron or steel components excluding COTS fasteners. Iron \nor steel components of unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the construction material contains \nmultiple components, the cost of all the materials used in such construction material is calculated in \naccordance with the definition of \"cost of components\". \nFastener means a hardware device that mechanically joins or affixes two or more objects together. Examples \nof fasteners are nuts, bolts, pins, rivets, nails, clips, and screws. \nForeign construction material means a construction material other than a domestic construction material. \nForeign iron and steel means iron or steel products not produced in the United States. Produced in the United \nStates means that all manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in the United States, from the initial \nmelting stage through the application of coatings, except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives. \nThe origin of the elements of the iron or steel is not relevant to the determination of whether it is domestic or foreign. \nPredominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both means that the cost of the iron and steel content exceeds 50 \npercent of the total cost of all its components. The cost of iron and steel is the cost of the iron or steel mill products (such \nas bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the manufacture of the product and a good faith \nestimate of the cost of iron or steel components excluding COTS fasteners. \nSteel means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent iron, between 0.02 and 2 percent carbon, and may include other \nelements. \n\"United States\" means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas. \n(b) Domestic preference. \n(1)  This  clause  implements  41 U.S.C.chapter 83, Buy American, by providing a preference for domestic \nconstruction material. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, the domestic content test of the Buy American \nstatute is waived for construction material that is a COTS item, except that for construction material that \nconsists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the domestic content test is \napplied only to the iron and steel content of the construction materials, excluding COTS fasteners. (See \nFAR 12.505(a)(2)). The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, \nexcept as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause. \n(2) This requirement does not apply to information technology that is a commercial product or to \nthe construction materials or components listed by the Government as follows: \n___________None_______________________________________ \n(3) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this \nclause if the Government determines that- \n(i)   The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. \n(A) For domestic construction material that is not a critical item or does not contain critical \ncomponents. \n(1)  The cost of a particular domestic construction material subject to the requirements of \nthe Buy American statute is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the \ncost of foreign material by more than 20 percent; \n(2)  For  construction material that is not a COTS item and does not consist wholly \nor predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, if the cost of a \nparticular domestic construction material is determined to be unreasonable or there is \nno domestic offer received, and the low offer is for foreign construction material that is \nmanufactured in the United States and does not exceed 55 percent domestic content, \nthe Contracting Officer will treat the lowest offer of foreign construction material that \nexceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic offer and determine whether the \ncost of that offer is unreasonable by applying the evaluation factor listed in paragraph \n(b)(3)(i)(A)(1) of this clause. \n(3)  The procedures in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A)(2) of this clause will no longer apply as of \nJanuary 1, 2030. \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 27 of 54 \n \n \n \n(B) For domestic construction material that is a critical item or contains critical components. \n(1)    The cost of a particular domestic construction material that is a critical item or \ncontains critical components, subject to the requirements of the Buy American statute, \nis unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by \nmore than 20 percent plus the additional preference factor identified for the critical \nitem or construction material containing critical components listed at FAR 25.105. \n(2     )For     construction material that does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel \nor a combination of both, if the cost of a particular domestic construction material is \ndetermined to be unreasonable or there is no domestic offer received, and the \nlow offer is for foreign construction material that does not exceed 55 percent domestic \ncontent, the Contracting Officer will treat the lowest \nforeign offer of construction material that is manufactured in the United States and \nexceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic offer, and determine whether the \ncost of that offer is unreasonable by applying the evaluation factor listed in paragraph \n(b)(3)(i)(B)(1) of this clause. \n(3)    The procedures in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B)(2) of this clause will no longer apply as of \nJanuary 1, 2030. \n(ii)   The application of the restriction of the Buy American statute to a particular construction material \nwould be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or \n(iii) The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient \nand reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. \n(c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American statute. \n(1)  \n(i)   Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of \nthis clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including- \n(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials; \n(B) Unit of measure; \n(C) Quantity; \n(D) Price; \n(E) Time of delivery or availability; \n(F) Location of the construction project; \n(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and \n(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in \naccordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause. \n(ii)  A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a \ncompleted price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause. \n(iii)  The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and any \napplicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued). \n(iv) Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain why the \nContractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have \nrequested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory \nexplanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination. \n(2)  If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American statute applies \nand the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will \nmodify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the \nexception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less \nthan the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause. \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 28 of 54 \n \n \n \n(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American statute applies, use of foreign \nconstruction material is noncompliant with the Buy American statute. \n(d) Data.

To the \nextent feasible, the Department of State will respond to such email inquiries within 3 business days. \n(d) Do not submit an offer unless— \n(1) A certification is provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this provision and submitted with the offer; or \n(2) In accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this provision, the Offeror provides with its offer information that the \nPresident of the United States has \n(i) Waived application under 22 U.S.C. 2593e(d) or (e); or \n(ii) Determined under 22 U.S.C. 2593e(g)(2) that the entity has ceased all activities for which measures were \nimposed under 22 U.S.C. 2593e(b). \n(e) Remedies.

BASIS FOR AWARD \n \n1.   The Government will conduct a source selection using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source \nSelection Process defined at FAR Part 15.101-2.  The Contracting Officer (CO) will obligate and award a \ncontract to the offeror who submits a proposal the Source Selection Authority (SSA) determines conforms to \nsolicitation requirements; is fair and reasonable; and provides the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting \nor exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors, considering all evaluation factors combined as \ndetailed below.  For this acquisition, the CO is the SSA.   \n \n2.   Additionally, pursuant to FAR 52.215-1(f), Contract Award, contained herein: \n     The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.  \n     The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.  \n     The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with \nofferors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal \nshould contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government \nreserves the right to conduct discussions if the CO later determines them to be necessary.  \n \nB.         EVALUATION         PROCESS \n \nAll proposal evaluations will be conducted in strict confidence.  The number and identities of offerors and proposal \ncontents will be revealed only to individuals involved in the evaluation process.  No information will be revealed to \nother offerors.  The evaluation process is as follows: \n \n1.   Initial Review:  Proposals will be reviewed for compliance with the solicitation to verify that all submission \nrequirements are met; all certifications are complete, and the offeror is responsive and otherwise eligible to \nreceive award of a Federal contract.  If the proposal does not comply or lacks sufficient information to be \nmeaningfully evaluated, it may be eliminated from further consideration for award. \n2.   Non-Price Evaluation:  A Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) comprised of Government personnel, with \nassistance from non-Government advisors when required, will conduct a non-price evaluation of proposals.  \nThe TEP will review and evaluate proposals against the technical factors contained in this solicitation. The \nTEP will not have knowledge of any pricing until the technical evaluation is complete. One of the following \nrating will be assigned to each of the Technical subfactors evaluated.  \n Technical Ratings. The ratings below include the consideration of risk in conjunction with the strengths, \nweaknesses, significant weaknesses, uncertainties, and deficiencies in an offeror’s proposal. These shall be \nused on all technical factors and sub-factors and sufficient documentation supporting these ratings shall be \nincluded with the ratings: \nAdjectival \nRatin\ng  \nDescription  \nAcceptable \n- Offeror provided all required information \n- All information provided is recent and relevant \n- Offeror demonstrated capability to handle projects of similar size and scope of the requirements of \nthe solicitation. \n- Offeror demonstrated a minimum of five (5) years of experience working with asphalt shingles. \nUnacceptable \nANY of the following will result in an Unacceptable rating: \n- Offeror did not provide all required information \n- Information provided is not recent and/or relevant \n- Offeror did not demonstrate capability to handle projects of similar size and scope of the \nrequirements of the solicitation. \n- Example projects do not include required information, including project description, starting and \nending contract amounts, and contact information for the reference. \n- Offeror did not demonstrate a minimum of five (5) years of experience working with asphalt \nshin\ngles. \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 53 of 54 \n \n \n \n \n3.   Past Performance Evaluation:  The TEP and CO/SSA will also evaluate offerors’ past performance.  The \nevaluation will assess the government’s confidence level for offers to successfully perform contract \nrequirements based on PPIRS data, and other pertinent, relevant information. \nPast Performance Evaluations/Documentation shall address the following three items. \n(i)Recency: Recency is generally expressed as a time period during which past performance references are \nconsidered relevant and is critical to establishing the relevancy of past performance information. \n(ii)Relevance: In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to those \naspects of an offeror’s history of contract (or subcontract) performance that would provide the most context \nand give the greatest ability to measure whether the offeror will successfully satisfy the current requirement. \nCommon aspects of relevancy include, but are not limited to, the following: similarity of \nproduct/service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, use of key personnel (for services), and \nextent of subcontracting/teaming. \n(iii)Quality: The past performance evaluation conducted in support of a current source selection does not \nestablish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past \ncontracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well \nthe offeror performed those past contracts. Requirements for considering history of small business utilization \nare outlined at FAR 15.304(c)(3)(ii). The Past Performance Evaluation will review all past performance \ninformation collected and determine the quality of the offeror's performance, general trends, and usefulness of \nthe information. \n4.   Price Evaluation:  Upon completion of the technical evaluation, the TEP and CO/SSA will review pricing. \nProposed pricing is an evaluation factor. Proposed pricing will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness. \nReasonableness will be determined in accordance with the proposal analysis technics identified in the FAR, \nDIAR and all other applicable statutes, regulations, and policies. The TEP will make an award \nrecommendation to the CO/SSA. \n5.   Selection:  The CO/SSA will select the proposal that the SSA determines conforms to solicitation \nrequirements; is fair and reasonable; and provides the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or \nexceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors, considering all evaluation factors. \n \nC.         EVALUATION         FACTORS \n \n1. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE \n  \na. Non-Price Factors: All non-price factors are of equal importance.    \nb. Overall:  Proposed pricing is an evaluation factor. All evaluation factors other than price, when \ncombined are approximately equally important to price.  \n \nc.  Price: Proposed pricing is an evaluation factor. Proposed pricing will be evaluated for fair and \nreasonableness. Reasonableness will be determined in accordance with the proposal analysis \ntechnics identified in the FAR, DIAR and all other applicable statutes, regulations, and policies.\n \n \n2.   VOLUME I – NON-PRICE PROPOSAL \n \na.   Technical   Factors   \n \nFACTOR 1 – PROJECT EXPERIENCE \n \nOfferors shall submit at least three but no more than five examples of projects similar in scope, size, \nand complexity, demonstrating a minimum of five (5) years of experience working with asphalt \nshingles.

The Contractor shall maintain complete inspection \nrecords and make them available to the Government. All work shall be conducted under the general direction of the \nContracting Officer and is subject to Government inspection and test at all places and at all reasonable times before \nacceptance to ensure strict compliance with the terms of the contract.  \n(c) Government inspections and tests are for the sole benefit of the Government and do not—  \n(1) Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for providing adequate quality control measures;  \n(2) Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for damage to or loss of the material before acceptance;  \n(3) Constitute or imply acceptance; or  \n(4) Affect the continuing rights of the Government after acceptance of the completed work under paragraph (i) of this \nsection.  \n(d) The presence or absence of a Government inspector does not relieve the Contractor from any contract requirement, \nnor is the inspector authorized to change any term or condition of the specification without the Contracting Officer’s written \nauthorization.  \n(e) The Contractor shall promptly furnish, at no increase in contract price, all facilities, labor, and material reasonably \nneeded for performing such safe and convenient inspections and tests as may be required by the Contracting Officer. The \nGovernment may charge to the Contractor any additional cost of inspection or test when work is not ready at the time \nspecified by the Contractor for inspection or test, or when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary. The \nGovernment shall perform all inspections and tests in a manner that will not unnecessarily delay the work. Special, full \nsize, and performance tests shall be performed as described in the contract.  \n(f) The Contractor shall, without charge, replace or correct work found by the Government not to conform to contract \nrequirements, unless in the public interest the Government consents to accept the work with an appropriate adjustment in \ncontract price. The Contractor shall promptly segregate and remove rejected material from the premises.  \n(g) If the Contractor does not promptly replace or correct rejected work, the Government may—  \n(1) By contract or otherwise, replace or correct the work and charge the cost to the Contractor; or  \n(2) Terminate for default the Contractor’s right to proceed.  \n(h) If, before acceptance of the entire work, the Government decides to examine already completed work by removing it \nor tearing it out, the Contractor, on request, shall promptly furnish all necessary facilities, labor, and material. If the work is \nfound to be defective or nonconforming in any material respect due to the fault of the Contractor or its subcontractors, the \nContractor shall defray the expenses of the examination and of satisfactory reconstruction. However, if the work is found \nto meet contract requirements, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment for the additional services \ninvolved in the examination and reconstruction, including, if completion of the work was thereby delayed, an extension of \ntime.  \n(i) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government shall accept, as promptly as practicable after completion \nand inspection, all work required by the contract or that portion of the work the Contracting Officer determines can be \naccepted separately. Acceptance shall be final and conclusive except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting \nto fraud, or the Government’s rights under any warranty or guarantee.  \n(End of clause)  \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 9 of 54 \n \n \n \nSECTION F – DELIVERIES OR PERFORMANCE  \n52.211-10 COMMENCEMENT, PROSECUTION, AND COMPLETION OF WORK (APR 1984) \nThe Contractor shall be required to (a) commence work under this contract within 7 calendar days after the date the \nContractor receives the notice to proceed, (b) prosecute the work diligently, and (c) complete the entire work ready for use \nnot later than 45 calendar days from the issuance of Notice to Proceed.

However, no adjustment \nshall be made under this clause for any suspension, delay, or interruption to the extent that performance would have been \nso suspended, delayed, or interrupted by any other cause, including the fault or negligence of the Contractor, or for which \nan equitable adjustment is provided for or excluded under any other term or condition of this contract.  \n(c) A claim under this clause shall not be allowed—  \n(1) For any costs incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor shall have notified the Contracting Officer in \nwriting of the act or failure to act involved (but this requirement shall not apply as to a claim resulting from a suspension \norder); and  \n(2) Unless the claim, in an amount stated, is asserted in writing as soon as practicable after the termination of the \nsuspension, delay, or interruption, but not later than the date of final payment under the contract.  \n(End of clause) \n \nSECTION G – CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION DATA  \n1452.201-70 AUTHORITIES AND DELEGATIONS (SEPT 2011) \n(a) The Contracting Officer is the only individual authorized to enter into or terminate this contract, modify any term or \ncondition of this contract, waive any requirement of this contract, or accept nonconforming work. \n(b) The Contracting Officer will designate a Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) at time of award.

FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts. The Department \nof the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to \ncomply with this regulation. One or more past performance evaluations may be conducted in order to record your \ncontract performance as required by FAR 42.15. \n2.   The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS. CPARS is a web-based \nsystem that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report. Once the report is processed, it \nis available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past \nperformance as part of a source selection action. \n3.   We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer (CO) with the name, position title, phone number, and email \naddress for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s) for the contract \nno later than 30 days after award. Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the \nContractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 11 of 54 \n \n \n \nreturning the report to the Assessing Official (AO). Information in the report must be protected as source selection \nsensitive information not releasable to the public. \n4.   When your Contractor Representative(s) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically generated \nemail with detailed login instructions. Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS \nis available at https://www.cpars.gov/.  \n5.   Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the AO will complete an interim or final past performance \nevaluation, and the report will be accessible at https://www.cpars.gov/.   \na.   Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the \nevaluation without comment.  \nb.   Your comments should focus on objective facts in the AO's narrative and should provide your views on \nthe causes and ramifications of the assessed performance.  \nc.    All information provided should be reviewed for accuracy prior to submission.  \nd.   If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating \"No \ncomment\" in the space provided, and then selecting “Accept the Ratings and Close the Evaluation”. \ne.   Your response is due within 60 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR. On day 15, the evaluation will \nbecome available in PPIRS-RC marked as “Pending” with or without comments and whether or not it has \nbeen closed. \nf.    If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 60 days, it will automatically be returned to the \nGovernment and will be annotated: \"The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date). The \ncontractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment.\"  \n6.   The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation: \na.   Protect the evaluation as source selection information. After review, transmit the evaluation by completing \nand submitting the form through CPARS. If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the \nform through CPARS, contact the CO for instructions. \nb.   Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization. Ensure the evaluation is never released \nto persons or entities outside of your control. \nc.    Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, pre-award \nsurveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes. \n7.   If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the CO no later \nthan seven days following your receipt of the evaluation. The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or \nother means during your 60-day review period. \n8.   A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for \nGovernment use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.   \n \n(End of Notice) \nELECTRONIC INVOICING AND PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS – INTERNET PAYMENT PLATFORM \n(FEB 2021)  \nPayment requests must be submitted electronically through the U.

As used in this clause— \nCommercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item— \n(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is– \n(i)   A commercial product (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of “commercial product” at \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101); \n(ii)  Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and \n(iii)  Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the \nsame form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and \n(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as agricultural products and \npetroleum products. \n\"Construction material\" means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a \nsubcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled \nfrom articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and \naudio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as \ncomplete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual \nparts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the \nGovernment are supplies, not construction material. \nCost of components means— \n(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place \nof incorporation into the construction material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and \nany applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or \n(2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of \nthe component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable \noverhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the \nmanufacture of the construction material. \nCritical component means a component that is mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States and deemed \ncritical to the U.S. supply chain. The list of critical components is at FAR 25.105. \nCritical item means a domestic construction material or domestic end product that is deemed critical to U.S. supply \nchain resiliency. The list of critical items is at FAR 25.105. \nDomestic construction material means— \n(1)  For construction material that does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of \nboth- \n(i) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States; or \n(ii) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if– \n(A)   The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 60 \npercent of the cost of all its components, except that the percentage will be 65 percent for items \ndelivered in calendar years 2024 through 2028 and 75 percent for items delivered starting in \ncalendar year 2029. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which \nnonavailability determinations have been made are treated as domestic. Components of unknown \norigin are treated as foreign; or \n(B)   The construction material is a COTS item; or \n(2)    For construction material that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, \na construction material manufactured in the United States if the cost of foreign iron and steel constitutes \nless than 5 percent of the cost of all components used in such construction material. The cost of foreign iron \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 26 of 54 \n \n \n \nand steel includes but is not limited to the cost of foreign iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, \nwire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the manufacture of the construction material and a \ngood faith estimate of the cost of all foreign iron or steel components excluding COTS fasteners. Iron \nor steel components of unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the construction material contains \nmultiple components, the cost of all the materials used in such construction material is calculated in \naccordance with the definition of \"cost of components\". \nFastener means a hardware device that mechanically joins or affixes two or more objects together. Examples \nof fasteners are nuts, bolts, pins, rivets, nails, clips, and screws. \nForeign construction material means a construction material other than a domestic construction material. \nForeign iron and steel means iron or steel products not produced in the United States. Produced in the United \nStates means that all manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in the United States, from the initial \nmelting stage through the application of coatings, except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives. \nThe origin of the elements of the iron or steel is not relevant to the determination of whether it is domestic or foreign. \nPredominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both means that the cost of the iron and steel content exceeds 50 \npercent of the total cost of all its components. The cost of iron and steel is the cost of the iron or steel mill products (such \nas bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the manufacture of the product and a good faith \nestimate of the cost of iron or steel components excluding COTS fasteners. \nSteel means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent iron, between 0.02 and 2 percent carbon, and may include other \nelements. \n\"United States\" means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas. \n(b) Domestic preference. \n(1)  This  clause  implements  41 U.S.C.chapter 83, Buy American, by providing a preference for domestic \nconstruction material. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, the domestic content test of the Buy American \nstatute is waived for construction material that is a COTS item, except that for construction material that \nconsists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the domestic content test is \napplied only to the iron and steel content of the construction materials, excluding COTS fasteners. (See \nFAR 12.505(a)(2)). The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, \nexcept as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause. \n(2) This requirement does not apply to information technology that is a commercial product or to \nthe construction materials or components listed by the Government as follows: \n___________None_______________________________________ \n(3) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this \nclause if the Government determines that- \n(i)   The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. \n(A) For domestic construction material that is not a critical item or does not contain critical \ncomponents. \n(1)  The cost of a particular domestic construction material subject to the requirements of \nthe Buy American statute is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the \ncost of foreign material by more than 20 percent; \n(2)  For  construction material that is not a COTS item and does not consist wholly \nor predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, if the cost of a \nparticular domestic construction material is determined to be unreasonable or there is \nno domestic offer received, and the low offer is for foreign construction material that is \nmanufactured in the United States and does not exceed 55 percent domestic content, \nthe Contracting Officer will treat the lowest offer of foreign construction material that \nexceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic offer and determine whether the \ncost of that offer is unreasonable by applying the evaluation factor listed in paragraph \n(b)(3)(i)(A)(1) of this clause. \n(3)  The procedures in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A)(2) of this clause will no longer apply as of \nJanuary 1, 2030. \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 27 of 54 \n \n \n \n(B) For domestic construction material that is a critical item or contains critical components. \n(1)    The cost of a particular domestic construction material that is a critical item or \ncontains critical components, subject to the requirements of the Buy American statute, \nis unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by \nmore than 20 percent plus the additional preference factor identified for the critical \nitem or construction material containing critical components listed at FAR 25.105. \n(2     )For     construction material that does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel \nor a combination of both, if the cost of a particular domestic construction material is \ndetermined to be unreasonable or there is no domestic offer received, and the \nlow offer is for foreign construction material that does not exceed 55 percent domestic \ncontent, the Contracting Officer will treat the lowest \nforeign offer of construction material that is manufactured in the United States and \nexceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic offer, and determine whether the \ncost of that offer is unreasonable by applying the evaluation factor listed in paragraph \n(b)(3)(i)(B)(1) of this clause. \n(3)    The procedures in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B)(2) of this clause will no longer apply as of \nJanuary 1, 2030. \n(ii)   The application of the restriction of the Buy American statute to a particular construction material \nwould be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or \n(iii) The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient \nand reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. \n(c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American statute. \n(1)  \n(i)   Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of \nthis clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including- \n(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials; \n(B) Unit of measure; \n(C) Quantity; \n(D) Price; \n(E) Time of delivery or availability; \n(F) Location of the construction project; \n(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and \n(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in \naccordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause. \n(ii)  A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a \ncompleted price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause. \n(iii)  The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and any \napplicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued). \n(iv) Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain why the \nContractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have \nrequested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory \nexplanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination. \n(2)  If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American statute applies \nand the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will \nmodify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the \nexception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less \nthan the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause. \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 28 of 54 \n \n \n \n(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American statute applies, use of foreign \nconstruction material is noncompliant with the Buy American statute. \n(d) Data.

To the \nextent feasible, the Department of State will respond to such email inquiries within 3 business days. \n(d) Do not submit an offer unless— \n(1) A certification is provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this provision and submitted with the offer; or \n(2) In accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this provision, the Offeror provides with its offer information that the \nPresident of the United States has \n(i) Waived application under 22 U.S.C. 2593e(d) or (e); or \n(ii) Determined under 22 U.S.C. 2593e(g)(2) that the entity has ceased all activities for which measures were \nimposed under 22 U.S.C. 2593e(b). \n(e) Remedies.

BASIS FOR AWARD \n \n1.   The Government will conduct a source selection using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source \nSelection Process defined at FAR Part 15.101-2.  The Contracting Officer (CO) will obligate and award a \ncontract to the offeror who submits a proposal the Source Selection Authority (SSA) determines conforms to \nsolicitation requirements; is fair and reasonable; and provides the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting \nor exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors, considering all evaluation factors combined as \ndetailed below.  For this acquisition, the CO is the SSA.   \n \n2.   Additionally, pursuant to FAR 52.215-1(f), Contract Award, contained herein: \n     The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.  \n     The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.  \n     The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with \nofferors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal \nshould contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government \nreserves the right to conduct discussions if the CO later determines them to be necessary.  \n \nB.         EVALUATION         PROCESS \n \nAll proposal evaluations will be conducted in strict confidence.  The number and identities of offerors and proposal \ncontents will be revealed only to individuals involved in the evaluation process.  No information will be revealed to \nother offerors.  The evaluation process is as follows: \n \n1.   Initial Review:  Proposals will be reviewed for compliance with the solicitation to verify that all submission \nrequirements are met; all certifications are complete, and the offeror is responsive and otherwise eligible to \nreceive award of a Federal contract.  If the proposal does not comply or lacks sufficient information to be \nmeaningfully evaluated, it may be eliminated from further consideration for award. \n2.   Non-Price Evaluation:  A Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) comprised of Government personnel, with \nassistance from non-Government advisors when required, will conduct a non-price evaluation of proposals.  \nThe TEP will review and evaluate proposals against the technical factors contained in this solicitation. The \nTEP will not have knowledge of any pricing until the technical evaluation is complete. One of the following \nrating will be assigned to each of the Technical subfactors evaluated.  \n Technical Ratings. The ratings below include the consideration of risk in conjunction with the strengths, \nweaknesses, significant weaknesses, uncertainties, and deficiencies in an offeror’s proposal. These shall be \nused on all technical factors and sub-factors and sufficient documentation supporting these ratings shall be \nincluded with the ratings: \nAdjectival \nRatin\ng  \nDescription  \nAcceptable \n- Offeror provided all required information \n- All information provided is recent and relevant \n- Offeror demonstrated capability to handle projects of similar size and scope of the requirements of \nthe solicitation. \n- Offeror demonstrated a minimum of five (5) years of experience working with asphalt shingles. \nUnacceptable \nANY of the following will result in an Unacceptable rating: \n- Offeror did not provide all required information \n- Information provided is not recent and/or relevant \n- Offeror did not demonstrate capability to handle projects of similar size and scope of the \nrequirements of the solicitation. \n- Example projects do not include required information, including project description, starting and \nending contract amounts, and contact information for the reference. \n- Offeror did not demonstrate a minimum of five (5) years of experience working with asphalt \nshin\ngles. \n\nSolicitation Date \n04/16/2025 \n Document No. \n140P4325R0015 \nDocument Title \nConOps East- Boston – John Fitzgerald Kennedy National \nHistoric Site \n– Replace Asphalt Roof  \n  Page 53 of 54 \n \n \n \n \n3.   Past Performance Evaluation:  The TEP and CO/SSA will also evaluate offerors’ past performance.  The \nevaluation will assess the government’s confidence level for offers to successfully perform contract \nrequirements based on PPIRS data, and other pertinent, relevant information. \nPast Performance Evaluations/Documentation shall address the following three items. \n(i)Recency: Recency is generally expressed as a time period during which past performance references are \nconsidered relevant and is critical to establishing the relevancy of past performance information. \n(ii)Relevance: In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to those \naspects of an offeror’s history of contract (or subcontract) performance that would provide the most context \nand give the greatest ability to measure whether the offeror will successfully satisfy the current requirement. \nCommon aspects of relevancy include, but are not limited to, the following: similarity of \nproduct/service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, use of key personnel (for services), and \nextent of subcontracting/teaming. \n(iii)Quality: The past performance evaluation conducted in support of a current source selection does not \nestablish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past \ncontracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well \nthe offeror performed those past contracts. Requirements for considering history of small business utilization \nare outlined at FAR 15.304(c)(3)(ii). The Past Performance Evaluation will review all past performance \ninformation collected and determine the quality of the offeror's performance, general trends, and usefulness of \nthe information. \n4.   Price Evaluation:  Upon completion of the technical evaluation, the TEP and CO/SSA will review pricing. \nProposed pricing is an evaluation factor. Proposed pricing will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness. \nReasonableness will be determined in accordance with the proposal analysis technics identified in the FAR, \nDIAR and all other applicable statutes, regulations, and policies. The TEP will make an award \nrecommendation to the CO/SSA. \n5.   Selection:  The CO/SSA will select the proposal that the SSA determines conforms to solicitation \nrequirements; is fair and reasonable; and provides the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or \nexceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors, considering all evaluation factors. \n \nC.         EVALUATION         FACTORS \n \n1. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE \n  \na. Non-Price Factors: All non-price factors are of equal importance.    \nb. Overall:  Proposed pricing is an evaluation factor. All evaluation factors other than price, when \ncombined are approximately equally important to price.  \n \nc.  Price: Proposed pricing is an evaluation factor. Proposed pricing will be evaluated for fair and \nreasonableness. Reasonableness will be determined in accordance with the proposal analysis \ntechnics identified in the FAR, DIAR and all other applicable statutes, regulations, and policies.\n \n \n2.   VOLUME I – NON-PRICE PROPOSAL \n \na.   Technical   Factors   \n \nFACTOR 1 – PROJECT EXPERIENCE \n \nOfferors shall submit at least three but no more than five examples of projects similar in scope, size, \nand complexity, demonstrating a minimum of five (5) years of experience working with asphalt \nshingles.

This document is intended to provide the necessary information/requirements for all contractors performing work at \nDepartment of Commerce (DOC) facilities. It is understood all information in this document may not apply for the specific \nproject described in the Statement of Work; however, it is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure the requirements \nare met when applicable. \n \n2.    Specifics of the activities are described in the attached Statement of Work and supporting documentation. \n \n3.    Questions about the requirements can be addressed to the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officers Representative \n(COR)/Project Manager designated for the specific task order. \n \n1.2 BACKGROUND \n \nThe Office of Facilities and Property Management (OFPM) Division manages and provides services to the DOC staff in support of \ntheir research, technical, and administrative programs.  DOC agencies serviced by OFPM include but may not be limited to: The \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), The National Telecommunications and Information Administration \n(NTIA), and The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). \n \n1.3 HOURS OF OPERATION \n \n1. DOC hours of operations are from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, on normal Federal workdays. Should the \nContractor desire to work at times other than those specified above, the dates and hours must be scheduled at least 10 \nworking days in advance and approved in writing by the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR). \n \n2. Use the Main Entrance at the DOC site for materials supply and entry for: \na. Special arrangements may be made through the COR for delivery of material/supplies, and/or overtime beyond these \nhours or on holidays. \nb. Check-in required at DOC Visitor’s Center located at the site main entrance. \n \n3. Employee identification shall include the name, country of citizenship, employer, and green card (if applicable) is needed for \neach Contractor and Subcontractor's employee working on the DOC site. These shall be submitted to the COR for review 10 \ndays prior to the work date.  After hours work will require a hard badge from the General Contractor and a COR/Federal \nescort 100 percent of time if accessing DOC buildings (see section 3.3). Follow the specific procedures pertaining to security \nand work hours prescribed by the COR/Security. Contractor vehicles must show current registration and proof of insurance. \n \n4. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Advisory System: \nNote: The following paragraphs describe the threat levels that may be changes at any time due to national security issues. If \na change is issued by the DHS all changes in procedures/directions for entering and performing work at the site will be \ncommunicated to the contractor through the COR. Contractor’s access to the DOC campus grounds may occasionally be \nrestricted as a result of a change in the Nation’s Threat Level when publicly announced by DHS.  \n \n5. National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) \na. The National Terrorism Advisory System, or NTAS, replaces the color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS). \nThis new system will more effectively communicate information about terrorist threats by providing timely, detailed \ninformation to the public, government agencies, first responders, airports and other transportation hubs, and the \nprivate sector. \nb. It recognizes that Americans all share responsibility for the nation’s security and should always be aware of the \nheightened risk of terrorist attack in the United States and what they should do. \n \n6. NTAS Alerts \na. After reviewing the available information, the Secretary of Homeland Security will decide, in coordination with other \nFederal entities, whether an NTAS Alert should be issued. \n\nb. NTAS Alerts will only be issued when credible information is available. \nc. These alerts will include a clear statement that there is an imminent threat or elevated threat. Using available \ninformation, the alerts will provide a concise summary of the potential threat, information about actions being taken to \nensure public safety, and recommended steps that individuals, communities, businesses and governments can take to \nhelp prevent, mitigate or respond to the threat. \nd. The NTAS Alerts will be based on the nature of the threat: in some cases, alerts will be sent directly to law enforcement \nor affected areas of the private sector, while in others, alerts will be issued more broadly to the American people \nthrough both official and media channels. \ne. NTAS Alerts contain a sunset provision indicating a specific date when the alert expires - there will not be a constant \nNTAS Alert or blanket warning that there is an overarching threat. If threat information changes for an alert, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security may announce an updated NTAS Alert. All changes, including the announcement that \ncancels an NTAS Alert, will be distributed the same way as the original alert. \nf. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \ng. Threat Levels: \ni. Low Condition (Green): A Low Condition is declared when there is a low risk of terrorist attacks. \n1. Federal departments and agencies will implement general and agency-specific Protective Measures to assure \nthat all facilities and regulated sectors take reasonable measures to mitigate vulnerabilities to terrorist attack. \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \nii. Guarded Condition (Blue): A Guarded Condition is declared when there is a general risk of terrorist attacks. \n1. In addition to Protective Measures taken in previous Threat Condition, Federal departments and agencies will \nimplement general measures in addition to agency-specific Protective Measures to check communications with \ndesignated emergency response or command locations, update emergency response measures, and provide \npublic with information. \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \niii. Elevated Condition (Yellow). An Elevated Condition is declared when there is a significant risk of terrorist attacks.  \n1. In addition to Protective Measures taken in previous Threat Conditions, Federal departments and agencies may \ndevelop protective measures for the DOC campus grounds such as increased surveillance, coordinating \nemergency plans as appropriate with nearby jurisdictions, and implementing contingency and emergency \nresponse plans.  \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR.  \niv. High Condition (Orange): A High Condition is declared when there is a high risk of terrorist attacks.  \n1. In addition to Protective Measures taken in previous Threat Conditions, Federal departments and agencies will \nimplement general and agency-specific Protective Measures for the DOC campus grounds. \n2. At this Threat Level the Government may restrict access to site and facility to essential personnel only.  \n3. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR.  \nv. Severe Condition (Red). A Severe Condition reflects a severe risk of terrorist attacks. \n1. Under most circumstances, the Protective Measures for a Severe Condition are not intended to be sustained for \nsubstantial periods of time. In addition to Protective Measures for previous Threat Conditions, Federal \ndepartments and agencies may close Public and Government sites and facilities as a protective measure. \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \n \n1.4 UNFORESEEN FACILITY CLOSURES \n \n1.    When an unforeseen facility closure occurs, the Contractor will either reschedule the work or perform the work on the next \nregularly scheduled workday. If the facility is closed, the contractor is not to be on-site unless notified by the contracting \nofficer they are essential. Contractor personnel may be required by the COR to remain on site to handle problems as a result \nof a closure, e.g., severe weather, national emergency, changes in national security levels. \n \n2.    Information about the status of the site may be obtained by calling the switch board at 303-497-3000.  Usually the day’s site \nstatus is available by 6 AM MST. Contractor can verify site status and sign up for email and text site notifications at the \nfollowing website:  \nhttp://www.boulder.doc.gov/cgi-bin/docstatus.cgi \n \n1.5 SANITARY FACILITIES \n \n\nToilet rooms in existing buildings may be used by the Contractor when performing work inside DOC owned buildings at the \ndiscretion of the COR. When toilet rooms in existing buildings are not available or work is being conducted outside the \nContractor shall: \n \n1. Provide temporary toilet facilities for use of all workmen. \n2. Provide the COR with keys to all temporary structures. \n3. Maintain toilet facilities in a clean, sanitary condition. \n4. Provide adequate supplies of toilet paper, cleaning and other required items. \na. Holding tanks for the collection of sanitary waste will not be permitted. \nb. Contractor shall install all pipes serving these trailers underground with appropriate cleanouts and provide measures \nto prevent them from freezing. \nc. Piping shall be run in an organized and pre-planned fashion and all piping shall be removed from the DOC campus \nupon demobilization of the Construction trailer(s) and the sewer main piping shall be restored to its original \ncondition. \n \n1.6 EQUIPMENT AND MATERIAL STORAGE \n \n1.    The contractor shall provide and store, in an area designated by the COR, all equipment, materials and required to complete \nthe project. The materials are required to be kept undamaged, clean and dry throughout the duration of the project. The \ncontractor shall also coordinate location of any trash receptacles, if necessary, with the COR and shall keep the construction \narea free of trash and debris. All equipment, materials and garbage shall be kept in a manner to avoid causing a hazard by \naccidental shifting, ignition or other hazardous qualities. \n \n2.    Prior to the start of work, Contractor shall meet with all Subcontractors to arrange and prepare a plot plan defining staging, \nstorage, field office and traffic areas within lay-down/staging and trailer/parking areas designated.  \na. Submit a plan for COR's approval not less than 10 working days prior to the installation of temporary facilities.  \nb. Except as specifically provided, working and storing outside these areas will not be permitted.  \nc.

This includes both the quantity and quality of runoff. This applies to the design and construction of new facilities or \nplans for redevelopment of facilities at the end of the life cycle. This requirement does not apply to repairs made to \noperable facilities such as roof repairs and resurfacing of roadways or parking areas. This requirement may also be excluded \nfrom a project if a separate project or phase of a large project is planned to meet the requirements of EISA Section 438. The \nCOR and contracting officer will make this determination. \n \n11. The dewatering of construction sites is covered under the MS4 permit if the groundwater to be removed meets the water \nquality standards in 5 CCR 1002-31 and 38 and has a total suspended solids content of less than 30 mg/L. There is no known \nor suspected contamination of groundwater at the DoC Boulder Labs. Discovery of suspected contamination (unusual odor, \ncolor, etc.) must be reported to the COR immediately. Dewatering and discharge to the storm sewer system may not \ncontinue until sampling and analyses have been performed and compliance with 5 CCR 1002-31 and 38 have been verified. \nPlans for construction projects involving excavation at or near the water table must include a plan to comply with these \nrequirements. Portable tanks may be necessary to contain water until analytical results have been received. The use of \nportable tanks to contain water prior to receipt of analytical results may be required. At minimum, settling of suspended \n\nsolids will be necessary. Note: Dewatering, treatment and discharge of contaminated groundwater requires a separate \npermit. Obtaining a dewatering permit from EPA may take up to six months. \n \n12. On construction projects required to be permitted under the EPA eNOI system, designs must be reviewed by a landscape \narchitect or landscape planner to ensure that revegetation will meet the requirements of the CGP and control the growth of \nnoxious weeds. All other construction projects must comply with NIST/DoC Boulder Labs requirements for revegetation. \n \n13. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or permit terms may result in work stoppage and/or other contractual actions. \na. On construction sites regulated under the CGP and eNOI system, contractors must begin repairs on deficient (improperly \ninstalled, missing or ineffective) stormwater BMPs on the day on which the deficient condition is first observed and \ncomplete repairs by the end of the following day unless replacement of the BMP is required. The CGP allows 7 days for \nreplacement of BMPs. Any failure to adhere to this requirement must be noted in the SWPPP log and reported to the \nCOR. \nb. For projects not regulated under the CGP and eNOI system, if deficient stormwater protection exists at the fault of the \ncontractor, the contractor shall make repairs according to the schedule in Item 1, aside from the requirement to \ndocument in the SWPPP log. \nc. If corrective actions are the responsibility of the government and require separate contract actions, acquisition of \ncontractor services and/or procurement of materials will be initiated by NIST AMD within 72 hours of receipt of a \ndefined requirement and evidence of availability of funds. \n \n2.10 FIRE PREVENTION/PROTECTION \n \n1.

This document is intended to provide the necessary information/requirements for all contractors performing work at \nDepartment of Commerce (DOC) facilities. It is understood all information in this document may not apply for the specific \nproject described in the Statement of Work; however, it is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure the requirements \nare met when applicable. \n \n2.    Specifics of the activities are described in the attached Statement of Work and supporting documentation. \n \n3.    Questions about the requirements can be addressed to the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officers Representative \n(COR)/Project Manager designated for the specific task order. \n \n1.2 BACKGROUND \n \nThe Office of Facilities and Property Management (OFPM) Division manages and provides services to the DOC staff in support of \ntheir research, technical, and administrative programs.  DOC agencies serviced by OFPM include but may not be limited to: The \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), The National Telecommunications and Information Administration \n(NTIA), and The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). \n \n1.3 HOURS OF OPERATION \n \n1. DOC hours of operations are from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, on normal Federal workdays. Should the \nContractor desire to work at times other than those specified above, the dates and hours must be scheduled at least 10 \nworking days in advance and approved in writing by the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR). \n \n2. Use the Main Entrance at the DOC site for materials supply and entry for: \na. Special arrangements may be made through the COR for delivery of material/supplies, and/or overtime beyond these \nhours or on holidays. \nb. Check-in required at DOC Visitor’s Center located at the site main entrance. \n \n3. Employee identification shall include the name, country of citizenship, employer, and green card (if applicable) is needed for \neach Contractor and Subcontractor's employee working on the DOC site. These shall be submitted to the COR for review 10 \ndays prior to the work date.  After hours work will require a hard badge from the General Contractor and a COR/Federal \nescort 100 percent of time if accessing DOC buildings (see section 3.3). Follow the specific procedures pertaining to security \nand work hours prescribed by the COR/Security. Contractor vehicles must show current registration and proof of insurance. \n \n4. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Advisory System: \nNote: The following paragraphs describe the threat levels that may be changes at any time due to national security issues. If \na change is issued by the DHS all changes in procedures/directions for entering and performing work at the site will be \ncommunicated to the contractor through the COR. Contractor’s access to the DOC campus grounds may occasionally be \nrestricted as a result of a change in the Nation’s Threat Level when publicly announced by DHS.  \n \n5. National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) \na. The National Terrorism Advisory System, or NTAS, replaces the color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS). \nThis new system will more effectively communicate information about terrorist threats by providing timely, detailed \ninformation to the public, government agencies, first responders, airports and other transportation hubs, and the \nprivate sector. \nb. It recognizes that Americans all share responsibility for the nation’s security and should always be aware of the \nheightened risk of terrorist attack in the United States and what they should do. \n \n6. NTAS Alerts \na. After reviewing the available information, the Secretary of Homeland Security will decide, in coordination with other \nFederal entities, whether an NTAS Alert should be issued. \n\nb. NTAS Alerts will only be issued when credible information is available. \nc. These alerts will include a clear statement that there is an imminent threat or elevated threat. Using available \ninformation, the alerts will provide a concise summary of the potential threat, information about actions being taken to \nensure public safety, and recommended steps that individuals, communities, businesses and governments can take to \nhelp prevent, mitigate or respond to the threat. \nd. The NTAS Alerts will be based on the nature of the threat: in some cases, alerts will be sent directly to law enforcement \nor affected areas of the private sector, while in others, alerts will be issued more broadly to the American people \nthrough both official and media channels. \ne. NTAS Alerts contain a sunset provision indicating a specific date when the alert expires - there will not be a constant \nNTAS Alert or blanket warning that there is an overarching threat. If threat information changes for an alert, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security may announce an updated NTAS Alert. All changes, including the announcement that \ncancels an NTAS Alert, will be distributed the same way as the original alert. \nf. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \ng. Threat Levels: \ni. Low Condition (Green): A Low Condition is declared when there is a low risk of terrorist attacks. \n1. Federal departments and agencies will implement general and agency-specific Protective Measures to assure \nthat all facilities and regulated sectors take reasonable measures to mitigate vulnerabilities to terrorist attack. \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \nii. Guarded Condition (Blue): A Guarded Condition is declared when there is a general risk of terrorist attacks. \n1. In addition to Protective Measures taken in previous Threat Condition, Federal departments and agencies will \nimplement general measures in addition to agency-specific Protective Measures to check communications with \ndesignated emergency response or command locations, update emergency response measures, and provide \npublic with information. \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \niii. Elevated Condition (Yellow). An Elevated Condition is declared when there is a significant risk of terrorist attacks.  \n1. In addition to Protective Measures taken in previous Threat Conditions, Federal departments and agencies may \ndevelop protective measures for the DOC campus grounds such as increased surveillance, coordinating \nemergency plans as appropriate with nearby jurisdictions, and implementing contingency and emergency \nresponse plans.  \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR.  \niv. High Condition (Orange): A High Condition is declared when there is a high risk of terrorist attacks.  \n1. In addition to Protective Measures taken in previous Threat Conditions, Federal departments and agencies will \nimplement general and agency-specific Protective Measures for the DOC campus grounds. \n2. At this Threat Level the Government may restrict access to site and facility to essential personnel only.  \n3. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR.  \nv. Severe Condition (Red). A Severe Condition reflects a severe risk of terrorist attacks. \n1. Under most circumstances, the Protective Measures for a Severe Condition are not intended to be sustained for \nsubstantial periods of time. In addition to Protective Measures for previous Threat Conditions, Federal \ndepartments and agencies may close Public and Government sites and facilities as a protective measure. \n2. Contractor coordinates procedures with COR. \n \n1.4 UNFORESEEN FACILITY CLOSURES \n \n1.    When an unforeseen facility closure occurs, the Contractor will either reschedule the work or perform the work on the next \nregularly scheduled workday. If the facility is closed, the contractor is not to be on-site unless notified by the contracting \nofficer they are essential. Contractor personnel may be required by the COR to remain on site to handle problems as a result \nof a closure, e.g., severe weather, national emergency, changes in national security levels. \n \n2.    Information about the status of the site may be obtained by calling the switch board at 303-497-3000.  Usually the day’s site \nstatus is available by 6 AM MST. Contractor can verify site status and sign up for email and text site notifications at the \nfollowing website:  \nhttp://www.boulder.doc.gov/cgi-bin/docstatus.cgi \n \n1.5 SANITARY FACILITIES \n \n\nToilet rooms in existing buildings may be used by the Contractor when performing work inside DOC owned buildings at the \ndiscretion of the COR. When toilet rooms in existing buildings are not available or work is being conducted outside the \nContractor shall: \n \n1. Provide temporary toilet facilities for use of all workmen. \n2. Provide the COR with keys to all temporary structures. \n3. Maintain toilet facilities in a clean, sanitary condition. \n4. Provide adequate supplies of toilet paper, cleaning and other required items. \na. Holding tanks for the collection of sanitary waste will not be permitted. \nb. Contractor shall install all pipes serving these trailers underground with appropriate cleanouts and provide measures \nto prevent them from freezing. \nc. Piping shall be run in an organized and pre-planned fashion and all piping shall be removed from the DOC campus \nupon demobilization of the Construction trailer(s) and the sewer main piping shall be restored to its original \ncondition. \n \n1.6 EQUIPMENT AND MATERIAL STORAGE \n \n1.    The contractor shall provide and store, in an area designated by the COR, all equipment, materials and required to complete \nthe project. The materials are required to be kept undamaged, clean and dry throughout the duration of the project. The \ncontractor shall also coordinate location of any trash receptacles, if necessary, with the COR and shall keep the construction \narea free of trash and debris. All equipment, materials and garbage shall be kept in a manner to avoid causing a hazard by \naccidental shifting, ignition or other hazardous qualities. \n \n2.    Prior to the start of work, Contractor shall meet with all Subcontractors to arrange and prepare a plot plan defining staging, \nstorage, field office and traffic areas within lay-down/staging and trailer/parking areas designated.  \na. Submit a plan for COR's approval not less than 10 working days prior to the installation of temporary facilities.  \nb. Except as specifically provided, working and storing outside these areas will not be permitted.  \nc.

This includes both the quantity and quality of runoff. This applies to the design and construction of new facilities or \nplans for redevelopment of facilities at the end of the life cycle. This requirement does not apply to repairs made to \noperable facilities such as roof repairs and resurfacing of roadways or parking areas. This requirement may also be excluded \nfrom a project if a separate project or phase of a large project is planned to meet the requirements of EISA Section 438. The \nCOR and contracting officer will make this determination. \n \n11. The dewatering of construction sites is covered under the MS4 permit if the groundwater to be removed meets the water \nquality standards in 5 CCR 1002-31 and 38 and has a total suspended solids content of less than 30 mg/L. There is no known \nor suspected contamination of groundwater at the DoC Boulder Labs. Discovery of suspected contamination (unusual odor, \ncolor, etc.) must be reported to the COR immediately. Dewatering and discharge to the storm sewer system may not \ncontinue until sampling and analyses have been performed and compliance with 5 CCR 1002-31 and 38 have been verified. \nPlans for construction projects involving excavation at or near the water table must include a plan to comply with these \nrequirements. Portable tanks may be necessary to contain water until analytical results have been received. The use of \nportable tanks to contain water prior to receipt of analytical results may be required. At minimum, settling of suspended \n\nsolids will be necessary. Note: Dewatering, treatment and discharge of contaminated groundwater requires a separate \npermit. Obtaining a dewatering permit from EPA may take up to six months. \n \n12. On construction projects required to be permitted under the EPA eNOI system, designs must be reviewed by a landscape \narchitect or landscape planner to ensure that revegetation will meet the requirements of the CGP and control the growth of \nnoxious weeds. All other construction projects must comply with NIST/DoC Boulder Labs requirements for revegetation. \n \n13. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or permit terms may result in work stoppage and/or other contractual actions. \na. On construction sites regulated under the CGP and eNOI system, contractors must begin repairs on deficient (improperly \ninstalled, missing or ineffective) stormwater BMPs on the day on which the deficient condition is first observed and \ncomplete repairs by the end of the following day unless replacement of the BMP is required. The CGP allows 7 days for \nreplacement of BMPs. Any failure to adhere to this requirement must be noted in the SWPPP log and reported to the \nCOR. \nb. For projects not regulated under the CGP and eNOI system, if deficient stormwater protection exists at the fault of the \ncontractor, the contractor shall make repairs according to the schedule in Item 1, aside from the requirement to \ndocument in the SWPPP log. \nc. If corrective actions are the responsibility of the government and require separate contract actions, acquisition of \ncontractor services and/or procurement of materials will be initiated by NIST AMD within 72 hours of receipt of a \ndefined requirement and evidence of availability of funds. \n \n2.10 FIRE PREVENTION/PROTECTION \n \n1.

          "content": "\n\n04/16/2025 \nSynopsis -  Notice of Intent to Sole Source \nDesign Services for Mechanical System and Roofing Integration, Ada, Oklahoma \nProposed Solicitation Number: 68HERC25R0144 \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s    (EPA) Cincinnati Acquisition Division (located at 26 Martin \nLuther King Dr. W, Cincinnati, OH 45268) intends to solicit I DESIGN AND PLANNING, LLC (iDesign) (2531 \nRidge RD STE 100, White Lake, Michigan, 48383-1750) on a sole source basis for a new firm-fixed price \ncontract for the design of Mechanical Systems   and Roofing Integration at the Robert Kerr Environmental \nResearch Center. This sole source solicitation will be made under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 Only \nOne Responsible Source and No Other Supplies Or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The \ndesign requirement requires the seamless integration of a newly proposed mechanical design with the \nrecently upgraded mechanical systems designed by iDesign. The mechanical design will build upon a \nconcept design prepared by iDesign. Therefore, iDesign is in a unique position to provide design \nintegration of the new mechanical and roofing systems into the current mechanical system. \n \nThe following is a partial listing of the requirements for this project: \n \n• Completion of mechanical conception design to 100% construction documents. (final IFC \nset, stamped drawings). Final 100% submission to include cost estimate. \n• Prepare Design Alternates   to replace roof at the Main Lab building  & Library and \nConference Center (LCC) (Alternates to be awarded at the Government’s discretion) \n• Refine mechanical, electrical, plumbing (MEP), structural, and civil elements as needed. \n• Integrate vendor data from pre-purchased mechanical equipment  \n• Develop detailed load calculations, layouts, and equipment schedules. \n• Coordinate with architectural and structural disciplines. \n• Develop detailed engineering drawings, specifications, and schedules. \n• Perform quality control (QC) reviews to ensure compliance with project requirements. \n• Conduct interdisciplinary clash detection and coordination. \n• Complete all final specifications, drawings, and submittal requirements. \n• Provide a permit-ready document package. \n• Address final owner and stakeholder comments before issuing documents. \n• The energy model should be performed in accordance with ASHRAE 90.1 and the Guiding \nPrinciples for Sustainable New Construction.  \n \nThe following is a partial listing of codes, standards, and regulatory references that apply to \nthe Project: \n \n• All applicable federal, state and local standards and regulations \n• All Oklahoma state, fire, safety and health regulations \n• All applicable NFPA Codes \n• OSHA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations \n\n• EPA Facilities Manuals (Volumes 1 – 4) \n• GSA Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service (P100) \n• National Electric Code (NEC) \n• Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS) \n• American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/American Society of Mechanical Engineers \n(ASME) \n• National Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB) \n• State of Oklahoma ICC Adopted Codes \n• American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineering (ASHRAE) \n• Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors’ National Association (SMACNA) \n• Guiding Principles for Sustainable Federal Buildings  \n \nConclusion: \n \nFAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source And No Other Supplies Or Services Will Satisfy \nAgency Requirements. \nThe nature of this acquisition requires the U.S. EPA to use the authority cited because of the \ncomplex nature of integrating the new design into the current design and roofing systems. \niDesign is uniquely qualified to provide the ongoing design services given their past role \nproviding the design services for the currently upgraded mechanical system. The utilization of a \ndifferent A/E firm would likely require additional engineering support and additional lead time \nto become familiar with the status of the design work as well as existing site conditions.  A \ndifferent firm would be forced to interpret the various elements of iDesign’s existing concept \ndesign to respond to questions raised by construction contractor.  This would result in a longer \ntimeline for the completion and additional cost to the government.  A sole source award to \niDesign will allow construction to continue with no disruption and effort lost. A disruption and \nrequirements delay are likely if a new contractor were brought in. iDesign is also uniquely \nqualified for this work because of their in-depth knowledge of the EPA Robert S. Kerr \nEnvironmental Research Center facilities. This knowledge is critical to minimize costs, keep the \nRobert S. Kerr laboratories operational and the building occupant’s safe during the design \nintegration. Finally—and critically—iDesign is currently providing construction administration \nservices for ongoing construction work at the Ada facilities. To inject a new A/E firm, with new \nengineers and architects, into the existing, fluid construction project is extremely impractical. \nQuestions would arise as to which A/E firm is responsible for reviewing and finalizing changes \nflowing from the new design, or for certifying that the new designs do not compromise features \nof existing design. Assigning liability for any potential issues would be very difficult. All of these \npotential challenges could result in construction delays or building closures. However, the \nresearch performed at the EPA Robert S. Kerr campus is mission critical and having a disruption \nin services, which could potentially close the labs for a period of time, cannot be permitted.  \nAs the continuation of design oversight, for the necessary laboratory consolidation, and \nconsistency of the known consolidation requirements, it is in the best interest of the \nGovernment to award this follow-on contract to iDesign. Utilization of iDesign avoids all of the \npitfalls enumerated above. \n\nThis requirement will utilize FAR Part 36. The product service code is C1DB, Architect and \nEngineering –   Construction: Laboratories. The North American Industry Classification System \n(NAICS) code is NAICS Code 541330 Engineering Services with a small business size of $25.5M. \nThe estimated construction cost of the work resulting from the design is under $10M. The \nanticipated Period of Performance is 7 months. Contract award is anticipated to be made Spring \n2025. \n \nTHIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  Notwithstanding, all responsible \nsources that believe they are capable of meeting the EPA’s requirement may submit a capability \nstatement, proposal, or quotation—that must address the outlined requirements above—which \nshall be considered by the agency. Such documentation must be submitted to the Contracting \nOfficer by 11:59 PM Eastern Time on May 1, 2025.  A determination not to compete the \nproposed firm-fixed-price contract based upon the responses received to this notice is solely \nwithin the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to the Contracting \nOfficer, Greg Forrest,  at forrest.greg@epa.gov. Responses to this notice must be submitted \nelectronically via email. Telephone responses will not be honored.\n  ",

Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The offeror is \ncautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its \nquotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by \nparagraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the full text of a \nsolicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es): https://www.acquisition.gov/far and \nhttps://www.acquisition.gov/diar\nClauseTitleDate\n52.217-5Evaluation of OptionsJUL 1990\nM.2 – PROPOSAL EVALUATION:  \nThe government intends to award a single firm fixed price contract from this solicitation. These procedures set forth the \nevaluation factors against which proposals will be evaluated, and the basis upon which a contract award will be made.  \nThe Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  However, the \nGovernment reserves the right to conduct exchanges in accordance with FAR 15.306 if the Contracting Officer \ndetermines them to be necessary.\nM.3 – EVALUATION FACTORS:\nThe evaluation will be conducted in two phases:\nPhase I.  Preliminary Screening\nPreliminary screening to determine if the proposal contains the data submission prerequisites described in Section L.  \nFailure to submit the required information will result in elimination of the proposal for award consideration (non-\nresponsive).\nPhase II.  Proposal Evaluation\nAfter Phase I, proposals will be evaluated using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable process defined in FAR \n15.101-2. Proposals will be evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. Only the lowest \nprice responsive offer will be examined for technical acceptability. If the lowest price responsive offer is technically \nacceptable, award will be made to that offeror and no other offers will be reviewed for technical acceptability.  If the \nlowest price responsive offer is not technically acceptable, the second lowest price responsive offer will be reviewed for \ntechnically acceptability.  The government will proceed in this fashion until the next lowest price responsive offer is \ndetermined to be technically acceptable. The contractor’s proposal must demonstrate the ability to satisfy all technical \nrequirements as set forth in Section C - Description/Specifications/Statement of Work and must conform to all required \nterms and conditions of the contract. \nPRICE EVALUATION: \nThe criteria includes consideration of information provided to support the proposal prices in Section B, Schedule of \n\nSOLICITATION NO.: 140A25R0032\nRoof Repair – Beclabito Day School\nPage 24 of 24\nItems. The Government intends to assess the price/cost breakdown to determine (1) reasonableness and (2) \ncompleteness.  The Government also reserves the right to evaluate for cost realism. Any inconsistencies between \nproposed performance and price must clearly be justified.  For example, if unique and innovative approaches are the \nbasis for an abnormally low proposed price, the nature of these approaches and their impact to the proposed price must \nbe clearly documented. The burden of credibility of price (ex. abnormally low) rests solely with the offeror.  The \nfollowing evaluation criteria shall apply:\na.    Reasonableness: Price reasonableness evaluations will use the procedures and techniques of FAR subpart 15.4.  \nUnbalanced pricing will be grounds for finding an offer unacceptable.\nb.    Completeness:  Price proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror provided sufficient data as \nrequired by the solicitation.\nc.    Cost Realism: Cost realism analysis may be used to determine if the proposed price is unrealistically low in \nrelation to the Government's Independent Cost Estimate, market conditions evidenced by other competitive \nproposals received, and the offeror's technical / management approach, such that there is a risk the offeror does \nnot understand the procurement’s technical requirements or may not satisfactorily perform at the proposed \nprice. The government will reject proposals for offering prices that are determined to be unrealistic.\nTECHNICAL EVALUATION\nA technical proposal will be evaluated on an “acceptable” or “unacceptable” basis. The Technical Evaluation Team will \nprovide a technical proposal a rating of acceptable or unacceptable, according to the chart listed below, and all elements \nmust be met in order for the offer to be rated “acceptable”.   \na.    Technical Standards:\n(i) Technical Approach:  An acceptable rating is met by a narrative that addresses all of the elements listed in Section \nL with a realistic and achievable approach that will effectively accomplish the work described in the Statement of \nWork. Logical inconsistencies, discrepancies between the approach and the Statement of Work, unrealistic or \nunachievable strategies, and factual errors will result in an unacceptable rating.\n(ii) Key Project Management/Technical Support: An acceptable rating is met when the proposal addresses all of the \nelements listed in Section L with a qualified team of key personnel, teaming partners, and/or subcontractors that \ncollectively can accomplish the work described in the Statement of Work.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not \nfinally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the \nliability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. \n(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax \nliability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection \naction is precluded. \n(ii) Examples. \n(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to \nseek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. \nShould the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all \njudicial appeal rights. \n(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been \nissued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals \ncontesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the \ncourse of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no \nprior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the \ntaxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal \nrights. \n(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely \npayments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is \nnot currently required to make full payment. \n(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection \naction is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). \n \n \n\nW912EF25Q0034 \n \nPage 25 of 40 \n \n \n(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
